        Tool inputs are processed locally in your browser and are not intentionally transmitted to or

      <p>
        We use Cloudflare Web Analytics to understand website traffic and page performance. The
        analytics service is provided by Cloudflare, and its script is added to our pages by
        Cloudflare.
      </p>
      <p>
        Analytics may report page views, visited paths, referrers, approximate visitor locations (such
        as country), device type, browser and operating system, and performance metrics such as page
        load time and Core Web Vitals.
      </p>
      <p>
        According to Cloudflare&apos;s documentation, Web Analytics does not use cookies or
        localStorage to track visitors. Tool inputs are processed locally in your browser and are not
        intentionally sent to our servers as part of analytics. For details, see{" "}

            We show ads served by Google AdSense. Google and its partners use cookies and similar
            technologies to serve ads, to limit how often you see an ad, to measure ad performance, and
            to prevent fraud. If you have consented (or where consent is not required), ads may be
            personalized based on your visits to this and other websites.
          </p>
          <p>
            Visitors in the European Economic Area, the United Kingdom and Switzerland are asked for
            consent through a consent message before personalized ads are shown, and can change their
            choice at any time through that message. Ads never have access to what you type into our
            tools: tool input stays in your browser.

        Like most websites, our hosting provider may collect standard server logs (such as IP address
        and request metadata) for security and operational purposes. This is separate from the content
        you type into our tools.
